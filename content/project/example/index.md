As a graduate student at UCLA astronomy department, I have been serving for 3 years as the coordinator leader for “Astronomy Live!” program, which is an astronomy outreach organization providing science demos and astronomy demonstrations to schools in the Los Angeles community. We have worked on organizing, coordinating and volunteering the outreach events to visit local schools or invite them to the UCLA campus. I hope to share my passion for science and astronomy through scientific outreach and education to interact with the community.
