I have been one of the committee coordinators for 5 years on the largest annual science outreach event on campus: ​Exploring Your Universe. It is an inter-departmental public science outreach fair that is held in November every year, and attracts thousands of members to the UCLA campus. 

Exploring Your Universe was founded in 2009 by graduate students in UCLA’s Astronomy department, and is now organized by volunteer graduate students representing several UCLA departments. This largest science outreach event on campus helps to bring scientific knowledge to our community free of charge.
