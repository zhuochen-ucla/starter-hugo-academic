abstract: The general theory of relativity predicts that a star passing close to a supermassive black hole should exhibit a relativistic redshift. In this study, we used observations of the Galactic Center star S0-2 to test this prediction. We combined existing spectroscopic and astrometric measurements from 1995–2017, which cover S0-2’s 16-year orbit, with measurements from March to September 2018, which cover three events during S0-2’s closest approach to the black hole. We detected a combination of special relativistic and gravitational redshift, quantified using the redshift parameter ϒ. Our result, ϒ = 0.88 ± 0.17, is consistent with general relativity (ϒ = 1) and excludes a Newtonian model (ϒ = 0) with a statistical significance of 5σ.

We used observations of the Galactic Center 16-year-orbit star S0-2 to test this prediction. We combined the measurements from March to September 2018, which cover three events during S0-2’s closest approach to the black hole with existing measurements from 1995–2017. We detected a combination of special relativistic and gravitational redshift. (See full abstract in the title link)
