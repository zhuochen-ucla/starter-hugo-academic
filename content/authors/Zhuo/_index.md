<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Welcome! I am the PHAST Postdoc Fellow in the Astronomy Department at the University of Washington, leading the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury (PHAST, PI: <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/benw1/">B. Williams</a>) survey program. My primary scientific research interests focus on understanding the origins and evolutions of galaxies, nuclei and stars we observe today using resolved stellar populations. I'm currently working on creating a legacy map of M31â€™s southern star-forming disk with photometric observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and investigating the ancient formation history, merger history and evolution of Andromeda.
